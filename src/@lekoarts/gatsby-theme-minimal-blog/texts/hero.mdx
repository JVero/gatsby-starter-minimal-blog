Hi!

I'm Joe Vero. I am the head of infrastructure at the [New Jersey Autism Center of Excellence](njace.us).  I am also a research programmer at the [Sensory Motor Integration Lab](sensorymotorintegrationlab.com), where I create multimodal experiements involving intertial measurement units and electrophysiological sensor modalities (EMG, ECG) and perform data analysis that characterizes neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder and Parkinson's Disease.

I use any tool for the job, and with many jobs requires many tools.  I have worked on major projects in Python, Go, C++, Matlab, and Swift.
